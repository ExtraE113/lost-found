<h4>Are you tired of all-school emails?</h4>
<p>Well then you've come to the right place. I hated getting three whole lost & found item emails a week! I was tired of not having a project! So I made this little web app where anyone can submit a lost or found item and <i> not </i> email the whole school about it!</p>

<p>This simple web app was written by Ezra Newman.</p>
